# Creating a New Scope

In order to create an Organization, you must be logged in as
a npm user with a verified email address. To create an npm user,
[click here][4]. There are 2 ways to create an organization:

- [New Scope][11]
- [Pre-existing User Scope][12]

### Create an Organization with a new scope: 

1. Log in to [http://www.npmjs.com/][5]
2. Visit [https://www.npmjs.com/org/][3]
3. Click the big red button "Create an Organization" 

## Organization Dashboard

Once you've created an Organization, you can perform a wide variety
of tasks on your Organization Dashboard.

Your Organization Dashboard is located:
```
https://www.npmjs.com/org/<org>
```
...where `<org>` is the name of your Organization.

## Adding Members to an Organization

By default, your Organization is set up with a [developers team][8].
Whenever you add a new member to your Organization, they are automatically
added to the developers team.

You may delete the developers team. If you do, newly added Organization
members will not be added to any teams by default.

For more information about the developers team, see [Developers Team][8]

To add a member to your organization, you add them by their npm
username via the [Organization Dashboard][10].

## Creating Team Admins

As the creator of the Organization you are granted the role of
[Super Admin][13]. 

For more information about the [Super Admin][13] and [Team Admin][6] 
roles, checkout the [Roles][7] documentation.
