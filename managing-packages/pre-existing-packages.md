# Pre-Existing Packages

## Restrictions

Currently, it is not possible to change the scope of a pre-existing
public or private, scoped or not, package to an Organization.

Specifically, given a private, scoped package `@ag_dubs/foo`,
there is currently no way to make that exact package scoped to
the Organization, `@ag_org`, i.e. `@ag_org/foo` without creating
a new package.

However, Organization members who are either a 

- [Super Admin], or
- [Team Admin]

that are also:

- an admin member of the package's org, for org-scoped packages
- the user, for user-scoped packages

and, as of `npm@3.5.0/npm@2.14.12`:

- the last publisher on a public package

... are able to grant Organization team access to packages that are
not scoped within the Organization.

### Examples

- `meow-org` Super Admin, Irina, is also a Team Admin for `pizza-org`.
  Irina can grant the `meow-org/cyborgs` team access to the 
  `pizza-org/pepperoni` package.

- `puppyco/corgis` Team Admin, Lewis, has a personal private package, 
  `@lewis/corgis`. Lewis can grant the `puppyco/corgis` team access
  to his `@lewis/corgis` package.

- `cactus-inc` Super Admin, Corey, was also the last person to publish
  the public package, `bdaypresent`. Corey can grant the 
  `cactus-inc/friends` team access to the `bdaypresent` package.

(*yup. this is weird. we know.)

Note: It is possible to migrate a User scope to an Organization scope.
For more information on that check out the
[Migrating a Current User Scope to an Org][1] in the [Creating an Org
documentation][2].

## Granting Team Access to a Package

So, let's say you have a package `@ag_dubs/foo` that you would like to
collaborate on within the Organization `@ag_org`.

First, ensure that you have the correct permissions. The user must:
- Be a [Super Admin] or [Team Admin] in the Organization
- Be an admin of the package, `@ag_dubs/foo`

Then, you can [grant team access to a package][3], as though it were scoped
to the Organization:

```
> > npm access grant <read-only|read-write> <org:team> @ag_dubs/foo
```

[Super Admin]: /orgs/roles#super-admin
[Team Admin]: /orgs/roles#team-admin
[1]: /orgs/setup#migrating-an-existing-username-to-an-org
[2]: /orgs/setup
[3]: /orgs/package-access#granting-access
[Organization Dashboard]: /orgs/setup#organization-dashboard
